# rectangle
comparing rectangles in c++

This is a basic program written in C++ to compare the size of an array (object type: <vector>) of rectangles. RectangleAreaComparator.h and RectanglePerimeterComparator.h contain classes with single member function `isLessThan` which compares the size of the rectangle based on its respective criteria (i.e. area or perimeter).

To acquire the program, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djdebonis/rectangle
```

then navigate to the directory 'rectangle.' Once in the repository, compile the files with:

```bash
make
```

and run the default output (.o) file with:

```bash
./a.out
```

The program will (1) print the meta data of all of the rectangles and (2) return the largest rectangles according to the aforementioned criteria
